## Overview

A neural network allows us to solve impossible problems that no one could normally solve. 

These problems are very difficult to model ourselves given our tools, so we allow a function to learn some expected outcomes in order to learn the underlying pattern behind it.

Networks solve problems like speech recognition, image recognition, and predictions.

These networks model themselves based on the human brain. Our neurons work by interconnecting with each other and holding weights and biases within themselves to properly convey their state. We model networks similar to this we have just simplified the process down and streamlined it to speed up processing for our own sake.

Neural networks have become more prevalent than ever thanks to the rise of GPU computing as neural networks are themselves just matrix multiplications perfect for a GPU. As of late new machine learning processors have come into production which streamline some common operations to further push training speeds and solve speeds.

## Problem Types

**Prediction**
- this is the simplest and most common use case for a neural network. It is where the model given all its training data tries to predict the outcome given some data.
- It manages to find the underlying pattern and makes use of it.

**Generation**
- generates new images

**Reinforcement Learning**
- Learns through a similar process of humans. By trial and error it is told what it does is good and what is bad by some sort of score system.

## Terminologies

#### Epoch
- Represents the number of trainings cycles done 

#### Network Layer
- A layer in a chain of operations that make the neural network structure as a whole
- A layer takes a tensor and runs some operation in it

#### Machine Learning
- The study of how these networks learn and how to optimize these processes

#### Neuron
- A cell which takes in inputs and based on its own internal weights and biases outputs its state to others

#### Loss
- The difference between expected values and the outputted ones.

#### Optimizer
- A algorithm responsible for determining the best way of tweaking the parameters within the network to minimize loss.
