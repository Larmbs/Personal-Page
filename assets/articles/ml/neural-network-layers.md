# Neural Network Layers
A layer in a neural network a stage within you networks flow where you can apply some operation on a tensor and then return a tensor.

### Neural layers

##### Linear
-this is a layer where every neuron connect with every other neuron completely.

### CNN Convolution Neural Network
This section of layers is primarily used in images recognition and other image processing algorithms.
[Wikipedia on CNN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)


##### Convolution
- A layer that applies a convolution to image and the uses a local neural network to convert from the initial channels to the final ones.
- This is useful for extracting the main features of data like edges by allowing user to apply their own filters.

##### Pooling
- Downscales data through some kernel
- This helps to speed up solve speeds by simplifying the network down to a more manageable level.


### Activation functions 
Layer which applies a simple function to every output neuron from network. These functions map over all neural network outputs and apply some function to change the data for network better performance.

##### ReLU 

##### Normalization
-normalizes values
