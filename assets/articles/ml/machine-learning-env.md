# Machine Learning Env
### My environment setup
---

## Overview
---

This is just a note on my current method of exploring machine learning through 3rd party programs and libraries. Machine learning is a demanding space requiring gpus and complex algorithms so this helps jot down my chosen dependencies.

## Environment
---
#### Kaggel 
- free Jupyter notebook environment that allows the use of gpu accelerators
- offers a terminal feature unlike google collab
- offers a pletera of gpu accelerators 


## Packages
---
#### Torch ecosystem
- PyTorch offers a high level interface to create a massive range of networks
- Has tensors which allow you to perform operations on data while keeping it differentiable 

#### tensorboard
- data visualization library for tensorflow
