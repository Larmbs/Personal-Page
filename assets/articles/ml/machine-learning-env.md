# Machine Learning Env
### My environment setup
---

## Overview
---
This is just a note on my current method of exploring machine learning through 3rd party programs and libraries. Machine learning is a demanding space requiring GPUs and complex algorithms, so this helps jot down my chosen dependencies.

## Environment
---
#### Kaggel 
- free Jupyter notebook environment that allows the use of GPU accelerators
- offers a terminal feature unlike Google Collab
- offers a plethora of GPU accelerators 


## Packages
---
#### Torch ecosystem
- PyTorch offers a high level interface to create a massive range of networks
- Has tensors which allow you to perform operations on data while keeping it differentiable 

#### Tensorboard
- data visualization library for Tensorflow
